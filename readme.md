## Overview
The `ansi.h` header file provides a collection of macros defining ANSI escape sequences for styling and formatting text in terminal applications. These macros enable developers to easily manipulate text output in terms of colors, styles, and cursor movements.

## Features
- **Text Styling**: Change text styles including colors and formatting.
- **Cursor Control**: Macros for controlling cursor movements within the terminal.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the usage of ANSI escape sequences with straightforward macros.

## Usage
Include the `ansi.h` file in your C/C++ project to access the macros. Use the defined macros to format text output in your terminal applications. For example, to set the text color to red, you can use the `RED_FG` macro as follows:
```c
printf(RED_FG "This text is red." ANSI_NORMAL);
```

## Limitations
- The file doesn't cover all ANSI escape sequences, focusing only common ones.
- Compatibility with all terminal types is not guaranteed.
